node-red-contrib-feedparser-simple
========================

A modified version of [node-red-node-feedparser-extended](https://github.com/RayPS/node-red-contrib-feedparser-2) 

Code was simplified.
Extended the input for injection, not only for timing, but also receiving the url as payload of incoming message. 
Returns all elements of the feed as single message.
